# Weekly Update July 14th 2022
- I have been working primarily to get the pipeline working with fastAI for training and inference
## Work Completed
### FastAI
  - Completed training pipeline using fastAI with multi categeory classification
  - Completed inference pipeline with fastAI that takes images from unreal environment
  - Learned datablocks and dataloaders for fastai

### Remote connection 
  - Got the unrealcv programs to connect and run remotely on pomona server with the help of Professor Clark
  - uploaded python scripts and jupyter notebooks to pomona server

### Automator 
  - Liz, Knny, Oliver and I met to go over the code used for the automator from last summer
  - Have a good idea of how the code works now
### Exploring alrternative training methods
  - Started creating rough scripts that could produce annotated training data based on photos and commands collected from moving the robot around the virtual envirnoment
  - Started altering original automator code to try to adapt it to our current goals

## Future Work
  - Get the oldenborg project up on my local machine
  - Add actors or a movable object unless already added, and modify blueprint to be compatible with the unrealcv python scripts
