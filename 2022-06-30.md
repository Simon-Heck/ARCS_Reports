# Weekly Update, 6-30-2022
## Network
  - Attempted to connect server side python scripts to UE5 running locally
  - Connection failed, traffic was being sent/connection completed, but scripts were unable to process data from unrealCV
  - Debug attempts hit a dead end
## Fast AI Setup
  - Locally installed multiple tools required for ML learning and fastai
  - Installed PyTorch
  - Installed Cuda version that matched by GPU's driver version
  - successfully tested cuda was availbale for my python programs
  - downloaded a test computer vision example dataset to classification
## Unreal Utilities Python Script Update
  - Completly remade UnrealUtilities.py
    - Added more methods
    - revised code to better align with project goals
    - Updated logic and testing for the program as well as the script structure
## UE5
  - Created an entirely custom event in blueprints for unrealcv test bed in order to control camera/pawn movement
  - successfully executed custom event in local UE5 console
  - some form of bug exists in UE5 where you are not always able to set the rotation of an object, and when it works it does not rotate the camera as expected
    - To get around this set camera rotation externally in python scripts
## Github
  - Attempted to add source control to UE5 project. It seems to have uploaded to a git repository, however it seems the file was to big
  - Addeded repository in ArcsLab github organization for python scripts
# Problems
  - Server unable to connect to local unrealcv instance
  - UE5 won't exept commands from unrealcv plugin sent externally unless they are preset or premade commands in unrealcv documentation
# Future work
  - Ensure fastai can train and classify on local machine
  - Try to find cause of URI error with unrealcv and UE5 project
  - Create a randomly weighted convulutional NN to make random movements in UE5 given a screenshot as input
